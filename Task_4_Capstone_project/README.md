# 🤖 AI Tax Assistant (RAG Pipeline)

A local, secure AI-powered assistant that analyzes Income Tax documents (Form 16, Salary Slips) and answers user queries with high accuracy. Built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ensure answers are grounded in the uploaded data, eliminating hallucinations.

## 🚀 Features

* **📄 PDF Parsing:** Automatically extracts text and tables from complex PDF documents (Form 16, Investment Proofs).
* **🧠 RAG Architecture:** Uses Vector Search (ChromaDB) to retrieve only the relevant chunks of data for the LLM.
* **🔒 Local Privacy:** Runs entirely offline using **Ollama (Mistral)**, ensuring sensitive financial data never leaves the machine.
* **⚡ Fast API:** Backend built with **FastAPI** for high-performance handling of requests.
* **🖥️ User-Friendly Interface:** **Streamlit** frontend for easy file uploads and chat interactions.
* **✅ Robust Testing:** Includes a comprehensive test suite with **67%+ Code Coverage** (Pytest).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **AI & Search:** Ollama (Mistral), ChromaDB (Vector Store), Sentence-Transformers (Embeddings)
* **PDF Processing:** PyPDF, LangChain Text Splitters
* **Testing:** Pytest, Pytest-Cov
